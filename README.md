# Wing Structural Optimization
A set of tools for wing structural optimization in Matlab.
This code was orginally developed for the SAE Aerodesign Brasil competition at
the UFMG's Aerodesign Team (Uai, Sô! Fly!).

## TODO
 - [ ] Refactor the code to be more modular.
 - [ ] Implement foil geometric torsion.
 - [ ] Implement wing sweep.
 - [ ] Implement foil aerodynamic torsion.
 - [ ] Implement composite ply analysis.
